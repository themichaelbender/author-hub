TEACHING
* Smile during teaching
* Speak at a proper rate (neither too fast nor too slow)
* Refer to "the last module" or "the next module," never using numbers
* Use corny expressions only once per course
* Be careful that "remember" references occur earlier in that course
* Avoid regional colloquialisms

SLIDES
* Make sure every graphic supports the lesson
* Enlarge fonts as much as possible (especially code)
* Use the highest-resolution graphics possible
* Ensure mouse pointer is hidden
* Inject on-slide motion at least every minute
* Don't reuse slide layouts in the same module unless necessary
* Ensure every learning objective is covered

DEMOS
* Enlarge code font as much as possible
* Never teach with the mouse; move it as little as possible and don't use it to highlight
* Disable mouse trail
* Use red or orange straight line/box callouts with no drop shadow, synchronizing time with instruction
* Use a fade transition to denote a jump in time
*

RECORDING
* Ensure the capture window is aligned (no line, cut-off material)
* Leave space between sentences during narration
 *
